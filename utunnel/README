udptunnel (c) Copyright 2004 Allen Porter <allen@thebends.org>

udptunnel allows you to tunnel TCP/IP connections (and more) through UDP
packets.  It also allows for the endpoints of these packets to be spoofed
as other machines on your unswitched LAN (think wireless or hubs).  This
tool is simply a proof of concept and the actual uses are left to your
imagination. 

In order to use udptunnel, libnet and libpcap are required.  I haven't
tested with any versions other than:

	- libpcap >= 0.8.1
	- libnet >= 1.1.2.1

Install instructions can be found in the INSTALL file, but the eager can
get away with issuing the following commands:

	./configure
	make
	make install

More features and documentation should be coming in later versions of this
program
