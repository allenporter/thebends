Library and tools for playing with the Port Map Protocol, based on the
draft at: http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-nat-pmp.txt

I've found that there are other NAT-PMP standalone libraries out there, but
they are less good and more expensive.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Some tools in this package depend on the google-gflags library, available for
download  at: http://code.google.com/p/google-gflags/
You can still use the core of the nat-pmp library without this flag library,
but you may also find it useful for your other projects.

TODO
----
The following items would be nice to have, and are supported by the nat-pmp
protocol:
- Support for notification of public ip address changes
- Support for retrying failed requests
- In memory table of requested mappings and re-creation of mappings on
  gateway restart.
