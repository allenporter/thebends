ynet is a small set of C++ classes used for building network applications. This
library depends on the ythread library.

To install, just run the following commands:

$ make
$ sudo make install

This library changes often, and interfaces may break from time to time.  The
latest revision can always be found at:
  http://thebends.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ynet/

TODO:
- Better standalone tests for this library.  It currently relies on testing
  done in other libraries.
- Non-async, threadsafe versions of all of some of these classes.
