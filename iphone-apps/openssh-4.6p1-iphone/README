Instructions for building OpenSSH for an iPhone
Allen Porter <allen@thebends.org>

This package contains a patch for building ssh on the iphone.  Please let me
know if you run into any problems.  These instructions assume the host machine
is an intel mac.

You must already have a working iphone toolchain. For the latest instructions:
    http://iphone.fiveforty.net/wiki/index.php/Toolchain_Project

You can find openssh-4.6p1 at http://www.openssh.com/portable.html

The CC, CFLAGS, and LDCFLAGS are all based on the current toolchain which is
known to change over time.

$ cd openbsd-4.6p1
$ patch -p1 < ../openssh-4.6p1-iphone.patch
$ CC=/usr/local/arm-apple-darwin/bin/gcc CFLAGS="-fsigned-char -DBIND_8_COMPAT" LDFLAGS=-Wl,-syslibroot,$HEAVENLY ./configure --host=arm
$ make
