quick start:
- register a fake service, get it to show up in bonjour browser
- listen on the port, tunnel the shit to the remote side

longer term:
- rewrite packets with different host/ports
- generic tunnel for arbitrary packets
- chownnat library implementation (samy?)
- GUI
- remote server discovery (generic web based api?)
